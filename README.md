## 🧠 Barot's Laws

A few personal truths I’ve observed, lived, and shared.

### 📜 Barot’s Law of Audience Jacking  
*To connect with your audience, talk to them like an old friend—use familiar language, skip the long words, and express through real moments in your story. Still, always match your tone to the topic and the people you're talking to.*

> *“Write like you’re chatting with a friend—but read the room.”*

### 🧩 Barot’s Law of Persuasion  
*Before pitching an idea to a group, speak to each member privately. Share it like a trusted secret, not just strategy—let them feel seen, valued, and part of something important. When everyone feels like an insider, the group moves as one.*

> *“Everyone wants a seat at the table—so give it to them before the table even shows up.”*
